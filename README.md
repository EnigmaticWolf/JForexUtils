JForexUtils is a collection of user-friendly, robust and useful tools for working with the <a href="https://www.dukascopy.com/wiki/#">JForex API</a> from <a href="https://www.dukascopy.com">Dukascopy</a>.

The purpose of this library is to avoid cumbersome boilerplate coding and an easier way of working the API.
Here's a short list of what can be done:

- Order creation, changing and closing in a simple and declarative way
- Creating/combining currencies and instruments from different sources
- Converting amounts from one instrument to the other
- Executing actions and callables on the strategy thread in one line
- Automatic reconnect support for standalone API
